# RoboND-WhereAmI


The fundamental problem in robotics and robots world is how a robot can, should navigate around in the world. It is pretty easy when robot controlled remotely and navigated around. However, when it comes to robot, it doesn't makes much sense remote controlling and navigating around rather give the robot ability to navigate autonomously. This powerful concept Localization radically changes the idea of how robot should navigate in known world and avoid obstacles, reach to destination. The Project gives the knowledge, ability to implement and test using Gazebo Environment and build own robot in gazebo, give it the ability to navigate around using ROS available packages like ROS navigation stack, SLAM, AMCL and etc.
 
 ## Project Tasks 

#### 1. Build personal robot in gazebo environment
#### 2. Load personal robot in given worlds
#### 3. Implement Localization stack
#### 4. Robot navigate autonomously to goal pose
